# arXiv Co-Release Checklist

> Coordinating a paper submission with a companion code release in the aumos-research repository.
> Follow this checklist top-to-bottom before hitting "Submit" on arXiv.

---

## 1. Pre-Submission: Code Review

- [ ] All source files have `# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` header on line 1
- [ ] All source files have `# Copyright (c) 2026 MuVeraAI Corporation` header on line 2
- [ ] All simulation files include the disclaimer:
      `# DISCLAIMER: This is simulation code for academic reproduction, not production implementation`
- [ ] No forbidden identifiers present (run `grep -r "progressLevel\|promoteLevel\|computeTrustScore" packages/`)
- [ ] All function signatures have complete type hints (run `mypy packages/<pkg>/src/`)
- [ ] No hardcoded production thresholds or latency targets
- [ ] All data is synthetic — confirm with `grep -r "real_data\|production_data" packages/`
- [ ] Dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` with pinned minimum versions

## 2. Pre-Submission: Test Suite

- [ ] `pytest packages/<package>/` passes with zero failures
- [ ] Coverage report shows >= 80% line coverage
- [ ] All random seeds are documented (search for `np.random.seed` / `random.seed`)
- [ ] Expected outputs saved to `packages/<package>/tests/expected/`
- [ ] Edge case tests present (zero trust level, maximum delegation depth, empty graphs)
- [ ] No `skip` markers left on test cases without explanation

## 3. Pre-Submission: README Completeness

- [ ] Abstract paragraph explaining the simulation's research context
- [ ] "Quick Start" section with a copy-pasteable code snippet
- [ ] "Disclaimer" section clearly stating simulation-only intent
- [ ] Link to the companion arXiv paper (update after submission)
- [ ] Link to the Colab notebook (`colab-templates/<package>.py`)
- [ ] `Installation` section with pip install command
- [ ] `Citation` section with BibTeX block (fill in arXiv ID after submission)
- [ ] `License` section referencing MIT

## 4. arXiv Submission: Preparing the Tarball

- [ ] Run `./scripts/prepare-arxiv.sh <package-name> --version v<X.Y.Z>`
- [ ] Inspect the generated manifest — confirm all expected files are listed
- [ ] Verify tarball extracts cleanly: `tar -tzf .arxiv-build/<tarball>.tar.gz`
- [ ] Confirm Python syntax passes inside the tarball:
      `tar -xzf <tarball>.tar.gz && python3 -m py_compile <extracted>/src/*.py`
- [ ] Total supplementary size is under arXiv's 10 MB limit for source
- [ ] Manifest file copied to `docs/` for permanent record

## 5. arXiv Submission: Paper PDF

- [ ] PDF includes "Code Availability" statement:
      > Simulation code is available at https://github.com/muverai/aumos-research
      > under the MIT license. All data is synthetic.
- [ ] Figures in the paper are reproducible from the companion code
- [ ] All figure captions note "Generated by simulation — not empirical data"
- [ ] Abstract does not claim empirical results from synthetic simulations
- [ ] Related work section cites relevant safety and governance literature

## 6. arXiv Submission: Code Availability Statement Template

Copy this into the paper's acknowledgements or a dedicated section:

```
The simulation code accompanying this paper is released as open-source
software under the MIT license and is available at:

  https://github.com/muverai/aumos-research

All results in this paper were produced using synthetic data generated
by the simulation framework. The code is intended for academic
reproduction of the theoretical results presented herein and is not
suitable for production deployment.
```

## 7. Repository Coordination: Tagging the Release

- [ ] Merge the feature branch to `main` via squash-merge PR
- [ ] Create a git tag matching the paper version:
      `git tag -a v<X.Y.Z> -m "arXiv:<paper-id> companion release"`
- [ ] Push the tag: `git push origin v<X.Y.Z>`
- [ ] Create a GitHub Release from the tag:
  - [ ] Title: `<Package Name> v<X.Y.Z> — arXiv Companion`
  - [ ] Body: paste abstract + BibTeX
  - [ ] Attach the `.tar.gz` tarball as a release asset

## 8. Repository Coordination: CHANGELOG

- [ ] Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`:
      ```
      ### Added
      - <Package>: <brief description> (arXiv:<id>)
      ```
- [ ] Move entry to `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` after release
- [ ] Link the version header to the GitHub Release URL

## 9. Post-Publication: Colab Badge

- [ ] Add "Open in Colab" badge to the package README:
      ```markdown
      [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](
        https://colab.research.google.com/github/muverai/aumos-research/blob/main/colab-templates/<package>.py)
      ```
- [ ] Confirm the Colab link resolves and the notebook runs end-to-end
- [ ] Add arXiv badge to README:
      ```markdown
      [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-<id>-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>)
      ```

## 10. Post-Publication: Social Announcement Template
